# CRE in Bombardier Beetle

## Overview
This project explored the **Chemical Reaction Engineering (CRE)** principles behind the bombardier beetle's unique defense mechanism. Guided by *Prof. Sonali Das*, it was conducted between **March’24 – May’24**.

## Literature Background
- Based on the groundbreaking **1960 Science publication by James et al.**
- Bombardier beetles eject a hot, noxious spray by rapidly decomposing **hydrogen peroxide** with hydroquinone in a specialized chamber.

## Methodology
- Developed **reaction engineering models** of the beetle’s explosive response.
- Used **MATLAB** to solve coupled differential equations for substrate consumption and temperature rise.
- Examined how internal compartments enable **controlled explosions** without self-damage.

## Results
- Model showed rapid depletion of reactants within ~2 seconds.
- Temperature rise validated the exothermic nature of the beetle’s spray (~100°C in milliseconds).
- Findings consistent with James et al. (1960), with additional parameter sensitivity analysis.

## Applications
- Insights into **biomimetic propulsion** and **chemical spray systems**.
- Potential applications in **defense engineering** and **controlled release technologies**.
